# Audio-Based Android Application for Blind Interaction

The Audio-Based Android Application for Blind Interaction aims to help visually impaired and blind people enhance their balance perceptions during exercise. The minimal viable product (MVP) is divided into two categories, user facing and research facing.  
User-facing provides practical features, attaching an Android device to one user’s lower back and using embedded sensors to detect the user’s body sway angle during the balance exercises, hence provide sound feedback regarding sway angle.
Research-facing has extra features, allowing researchers to collect experiment participants swaying data by generating CSV files on devices locally, and carrying out data analysis.
